# Syfre

## What Is Syfre?

Syfre is a simple app to track how long you've been sober from anything you want. It is a fork of KiARC's unmaintained [Sobriety](https://github.com/KiARC/Sobriety) app. It'll tell you how long it's been since you logged a relapse, and the average time between your most recent relapses, so that you have more input with which to work on recovery. syfre has no trackers, runs locally on your device, and every feature is completely free and private.

The name Syfre is an old [Anglo-Saxon word](https://bosworthtoller.com/29963) meaning _sober, not giving way to appetite or passion, pure, temperate, circumspect_. I want to make it somewhat more featureful than its mother app, which never meant to grow beyond its original breadth.
